# Autism Detection and Interpretation System

This project aims to build an *Autism Detection and Interpretation System* that utilizes *spectrograms, **eye-tracking heatmaps, and **EfficientNetB0* for detecting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in adults. The system leverages deep learning models for classification, computer vision techniques for data preprocessing, and heatmap visualization for interpretation.

## üîç Project Highlights

* *Input Data*: Spectrograms and eye-tracking heatmaps derived from stimuli.
* *Model*: EfficientNetB0 (pre-trained on ImageNet, fine-tuned on ASD dataset).
* *Task*: Binary classification (ASD vs. Non-ASD).
* *Interpretability*: Grad-CAM heatmaps for visual explanations.
* *Tools*: TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
* *Deployment*: Can be extended for web applications or clinical decision support systems.
